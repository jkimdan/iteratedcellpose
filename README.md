This repo was cloned from Cellpose. For Cellpose documentation and installation instructions, follow the fork link. 
The main part of this repository is the Cellpose code and library. Our work is under the `CSCSI3317_final_project` folder.
The data used for finetuning is located at [cv_data](https://github.com/juliancstrocodes/cv_data). There are also scripts there that were used for data augmentation. 

Our fine-tuned models are found in `CSCSI3317_final_project/models/model_links.md`. A notebook showing how we combined the output of our fine-tuned models with StarDist probability maps is found in `CSCSI3317_final_project/models/notebooks/stardist_prediction.ipynb`.
